# TechHub Electronics E-Commerce Analysis   
## About TechHub   
TechHub is a global e-commerce platform specialising in electronics and consumer technology products. Since their founding in 2018, the company has grown from a startup to an international retailer, distributing the latest consumer technology from leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad. Operating through their web platform and mobile application, TechHub utilises a variety of marketing channels, including email, SEO, and affiliate marketing, to drive customer engagement and deliver high-quality products to its customers worldwide.   

## Project Goals   
The company maintains a database consisting of orders, order statuses, customers, products, and geographic information. Despite containing valuable business intelligence, this data remains largely unstructured and underanalysed. This project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from TechHub's data to support strategic decision-making across Finance, Sales, Product, and Marketing teams, enhancing customer experience delivery and driving business growth.
