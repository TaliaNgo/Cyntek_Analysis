## Recommendations   
### Sales   
- **Discontinue low performer**: With poor performance across all metrics, TechHub should consider discontinue or replace Bose Soundsport Headphones with higher-potential alternatives.   
- **Optimise Iphone sales strategy**: Despite being a high-value product, Iphone sales are low and volatile. Investigate pricing, marketing, and inventory factors, and consider product bundling (e.g. with AirPods - the best-seller) to leverage the popularity of complementary Apple items.   
- **Leverage predictable seasonal patterns**: Optimise data-driven inventory planning - increasing stock levels ahead of peak months and reducing restocks during weakest months (Feb, Oct). Avoid launches in these two weak months and schedule releases in late August or early November to capture back-to-school and holiday demand surges.   
- **Stimulate low-season sales**: Introduce clearance campaigns or targeted discounts in February and October, potentially themed around events such as Valentineâ€™s Day.   
- **Focus on top 12 markets**: Concentrate expansion and marketing efforts on the top 12 countries (80% of sales) rather than spreading resources across all 193 markets.   
- **Leverage high-value APAC markets**: Focus particularly on Japan and target this market with high-value product bundles and exclusive loyalty offers.   

### Marketing   
- **Improve data capture**: Implement mandatory field tracking and system validation to improve data quality at point of capture.   
- **Optimise marketing mix**: Continue investing in direct and email marketing, which drive the strongest performance. Re-evaluate the affiliate channel: while smaller in volume, its high AOV and retention rate suggest potential for new customer acquisition if cost-effective.   

### Loyalty Program   
- The loyalty program has shown steady improvement and **should be maintained with ongoing performance monitoring**.   
- **Targeted engagement strategies**: Focus on personalised marketing channels (direct and email) and enhance the mobile app experience to boost acquisition and engagement. Explore TV sign-ups for potential growth.   
- **Address Apple product weak participation**: MacBook Air and iPhone severely underperform with loyalty members. Investigate the cause and consider tailored incentives or exclusive loyalty pricing to drive participation.   
- **Improve retention**: Non-loyalty customers show higher repeat purchase rates than loyalty members. Target repeat buyers with email campaigns to encourage loyalty program sign-ups.   

### Refund Management   
- **Reduce high-value product refund rates**: Laptops and Apple products account for the majority of refunds. Implement enhanced product descriptions, interactive demos, and post-purchase support to align expectations and reduce return rates.
