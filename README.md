# TechHub Electronics E-Commerce Analysis   
## About TechHub   
TechHub is a global e-commerce platform specialising in electronics and consumer technology products. Since their founding in 2018, the company has grown from a startup to an international retailer, distributing the latest consumer technology from leading brands like Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad. Operating through their web platform and mobile application, TechHub utilises a variety of marketing channels, including email, SEO, and affiliate marketing, to drive customer engagement and deliver high-quality products to its customers worldwide.   

## Project Goals   
The company maintains a database consisting of orders, order statuses, customers, products, and geographic information. Despite containing valuable business intelligence, this data remains largely unstructured and underanalysed. This project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from TechHub's data to support strategic decision-making across Finance, Sales, Product, and Marketing teams, enhancing customer experience delivery and driving business growth.   

## Stakeholder Questions for Analysis    
- What were the sales trends from 2019 to 2022?   
-	What were the monthly and yearly growth rates during this time?   
-	How is the new loyalty program performing? Should the company keep using it?   
-	What were the refund rates and average order value (AOV)? Specifically, focus on Apple products.   

For these questions, we focus on the 3 main metrics â€“ **order counts**, **sales revenue**, and **AOV**.   

## Executive Summary   
- **Sales Trends**: Sales grew steadily from 2019 through 2021, **peaking in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic** before declining to pre-pandemic levels by late 2022. Over the four years (2019-2022), the company generated **$28M in total sales** across **108K orders** from **87.6K customers**, with an **average order value of $253**. Peak performance occurred in 2020 with the highest revenue (**$10M**) and AOV (**$300**), while 2021 recorded the highest unit sold (**36K**).   
- **Growth Rates**: 2020 experienced exponential growth with **units sold doubling** and **revenue tripling** YoY (**up 163% from 2019**). However, 2022 saw a sharp reversal with sales declining **40-45% from 2021 levels**. The steepest monthly decline occurred in October 2022, while March 2020 saw the strongest MoM surge of **50%** as pandemic-driven demand accelerated.
- **Loyalty Program**: The loyalty program has had very stable performance, with a steady increase across all metrics from 2019 to 2021, peaking at **$4.9M sales, 19.5K units sold, and $249 AOV in 2021**. Despite a slight decrease, these metrics outperform non-loyalty program users through 2022.
- **Refund Rates**: Refund rates **averaged 4% annually by units and 7% by revenue**, peaking in **2020 at 13% of revenue and 3.61% of units**, before declining to **0% in 2022** (likely due to incomplete data). **Laptops showed the highest refund rates** by category, with **Apple products accounting for 50% of all refunds**.
